## Project Description
Since school related materials are very expensive due to economic reasons, we thought of an app that enables students to sell their second-hand school materials on an online platform. In this app, students can either find and buy the necessary material or they can sell the materials that they do not need anymore. This app is focused exclusively on university students so only university stu-dents will be able to register and use our app with their edu.tr mail in order to create a much more reliable and trustworthy sales environment.
